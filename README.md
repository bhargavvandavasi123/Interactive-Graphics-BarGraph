# Interactive-Graphics-BarGraph

### My first graph is Bar graph that shows the average attendance percentages of Departments, Courses in those departments, modules in that courses and then students enrolled in that module, and their marks, at last modules selected by student and their marks in that module.
#### A total of 5 bar graphs are implemented in this work.
1. When this project loads it first displays the graph as shown in “Fig:1” which shows the average attendance percentages of each department with x-axis showing percentages and y-axis showing department codes. A tooltip is implemented which displays department code and average attendance percentage. When user clicks on any of the bars it takes to another graph as shown in “Fig:2”
2. This graph shows the average attendance percentages of each course codes present in the selected department with x-axis showing percentages and y-axis showing course codes. Course are of two types Under graduates and post graduates which are differentiated using colours. Also a previous button is implemented which when clicked, takes to the previous graph. When user clicks on any of the bars it takes to another graph.
3. This graph shows the average attendance percentages of each module present under the selected course with x-axis showing percentages and y-axis showing module codes. When user clicks on any of the bars it takes to another graph.
4. This graph shows the marks of all the students in a selected module form the previous graph with x-axis showing marks and y-axis representing student id’s. When user clicks on any of the bars it takes to the another graph.
5. This is the final graph which shows the marks of all the modules of a particular student selected in the previous graph with x-axis showing marks and y-axis representing module codes.

“Note: In this graphs bars with zero attendance and zero marks will also be displayed.”
